        "1. What is a RESTful AP?\n",
        "A. A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is a web service that follows REST architecture principles to enable communication between systems over HTTP. It uses standard HTTP methods—GET, POST, PUT, DELETE—to perform operations on resources identified by URLs. RESTful APIs are stateless, meaning each request contains all needed information, allowing for scalability and simplicity. They typically return data in formats like JSON or XML. RESTful APIs are widely used in web and mobile applications to connect front-end interfaces with back-end services efficiently and reliably while maintaining a clear and intuitive structure.\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of API specification.\n",
        "A. An API specification is a formal document that outlines how an API behaves and how developers should interact with it. It defines available endpoints, request methods (e.g., GET, POST), required parameters, data formats, authentication methods, and expected responses. The specification ensures consistency, clarity, and interoperability across systems by serving as a contract between API providers and consumers. Common formats include OpenAPI (formerly Swagger), RAML, and API Blueprint. With a clear API specification, developers can build, test, and integrate applications more efficiently, reducing errors and improving communication between different software components or teams.\n",
        "3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        "A. Flask is a lightweight, open-source Python web framework used to build web applications and APIs. It is popular for its simplicity, flexibility, and minimalistic design, allowing developers to create scalable APIs quickly with minimal boilerplate code. Flask supports extensions for added functionality, such as database integration and authentication, while still keeping the core framework unopinionated. Its clear documentation and active community make it beginner-friendly and widely adopted. Flask is ideal for small to medium-sized projects and rapid prototyping, offering full control over application structure and behavior without enforcing strict development patterns.\n",
        "4. What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "A. Routing in Flask is the process of defining URL patterns that are linked to specific functions, called view functions, which handle incoming HTTP requests. Each route in Flask is created using the @app.route() decorator, which maps a URL path to a Python function. When a client sends a request to a particular URL, Flask matches it to the appropriate route and executes the corresponding function to generate a response. Routing allows developers to organize application logic around different endpoints, enabling dynamic content generation, user interaction, and API creation. It’s fundamental for building web applications and RESTful APIs with Flask.\n",
        "5. How do you create a simple Flask application?\n",
        "To create a simple Flask application, start by installing Flask using a package manager like pip. Then, create a new Python file where you initialize a Flask application object. Define at least one route using a special decorator to map a URL path (like the homepage) to a function that returns a response, such as a string. Finally, run the application using Flask's built-in development server.\n",
        "6. What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n",
        "A. HTTP methods in RESTful APIs define the type of operation to be performed on a resource. The most common methods are:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **GET**: Retrieves data from the server without modifying it.\n",
        "* **POST**: Sends new data to the server, often creating a new resource.\n",
        "* **PUT**: Updates an existing resource by replacing it entirely.\n",
        "* **PATCH**: Partially updates an existing resource.\n",
        "* **DELETE**: Removes a specified resource from the server.\n",
        "\n",
        "These methods align with CRUD operations—Create, Read, Update, Delete—and provide a standardized way to interact with resources over HTTP in RESTful architectures.\n",
        "7. What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n",
        "A. The purpose of the `@app.route()` decorator in Flask is to define a route in your web application by linking a specific URL path to a Python function (called a view function). When a user visits the specified URL, Flask calls the associated function and returns its output as the response. This decorator essentially tells Flask, “When this URL is requested, run this function.” It’s a key part of routing in Flask, enabling the application to handle different web requests and serve dynamic content or API responses based on the URL path.\n",
        "8. What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
        "A. The main difference between **GET** and **POST** HTTP methods lies in how they send data and their intended use:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **GET** is used to request data from a server. It sends data as part of the URL (in the query string), making it visible and limited in length. GET requests are safe and idempotent, meaning they don’t alter server state and can be repeated without side effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **POST** is used to submit data to a server, often to create or update resources. It sends data in the request body, allowing for larger and more secure data transmission. POST can change server state.\n",
        "9.  How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n",
        "A. In Flask APIs, errors are handled by defining custom error handlers or using built-in error responses. You can create functions decorated with @app.errorhandler for specific HTTP status codes, to return custom JSON responses or messages when those errors occur. Additionally, you can use try-except blocks within your view functions to catch exceptions and return meaningful error responses with appropriate status codes. Flask’s flexibility allows you to provide clear, consistent error messages, improving API usability and debugging. Using tools like Flask-RESTful also simplifies error handling by standardizing responses.\n",
        "10. How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n",
        "A. To connect Flask to a SQL database, you typically use an extension like Flask-SQLAlchemy, which provides an easy way to interact with databases using Python’s SQLAlchemy ORM. First, you install Flask-SQLAlchemy and configure your Flask app with the database connection URL (including database type, username, password, host, and database name). Then, you initialize the SQLAlchemy object with your app. After that, you define your database models as Python classes, representing tables. Finally, you can perform database operations like querying, inserting, updating, or deleting records directly through these models within your Flask application.\n",
        "11. What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n",
        "A. Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension that integrates SQLAlchemy, a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library, with Flask. Its role is to simplify database interactions by allowing developers to work with databases using Python classes and objects instead of writing raw SQL queries. Flask-SQLAlchemy handles database connections, schema definitions, and query construction, making it easier to create, read, update, and delete data. It also manages migrations and transactions seamlessly within Flask applications. Overall, it provides a convenient, high-level interface to relational databases, improving productivity and maintainability in Flask projects.\n",
        "12.  What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n",
        "A. Flask blueprints are a way to organize and structure a Flask application by grouping related routes, templates, and static files into reusable, modular components. They allow developers to split large applications into smaller, manageable parts, making the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain. Blueprints support code reuse, facilitate collaborative development, and enable the creation of scalable applications by registering multiple blueprints with the main Flask app. This modularity also helps in logically separating features like user authentication, admin panels, or APIs within the same project, improving overall project organization and flexibility.\n",
        "13. What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n",
        "A. Flask’s `request` object represents the incoming HTTP request from a client. Its purpose is to provide access to all the data sent with that request, such as form data, query parameters, headers, cookies, and JSON payloads. Developers use the `request` object within view functions to read user input, handle submitted forms, or extract information needed to process the request and generate an appropriate response. It’s essential for interacting dynamically with clients, enabling Flask applications to respond based on the details of each individual HTTP request.\n",
        "14.  How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask?\n",
        "A. To create a RESTful API endpoint in Flask, you first set up a Flask application and then define a route using the decorator that corresponds to the URL path of the API endpoint. Inside the associated view function, you handle HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE to perform actions on resources. The function processes incoming requests—such as reading JSON data from the client—and returns appropriate responses, often in JSON format. This structure enables clients to interact with the API by sending requests to defined URLs that represent resources or actions.\n",
        "15. What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function?\n",
        "A. Flask’s `jsonify()` function is used to create a JSON-formatted HTTP response easily and correctly. It converts Python data structures like dictionaries or lists into JSON strings and sets the appropriate `Content-Type` header (`application/json`) automatically. This ensures that API responses are properly formatted for clients expecting JSON, which is the standard data format for RESTful APIs. Using `jsonify()` simplifies response creation, improves consistency, and helps avoid errors compared to manually converting data to JSON and setting headers.\n",
        "16. Explain Flask’s url_for() function.\n",
        "A. Flask’s url_for() function generates a URL for a given view function based on its name, rather than hardcoding URLs as strings. It helps create dynamic, maintainable links within your application by building URLs using the function’s endpoint and any arguments it requires. This ensures that if routes change, you don’t need to update URLs throughout your code—only the route definition. It also supports generating URLs for static files. Overall, url_for() improves code reliability, readability, and flexibility when managing navigation and resource linking in Flask applications.\n",
        "17. How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)?\n",
        "A. Flask handles static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images by serving them from a special folder named static within the project directory. When you place your static assets in this folder, Flask automatically makes them accessible via URLs starting with static.In templates, you typically use Flask’s url_for('static', filename='...') function to generate the correct URL, ensuring proper linking regardless of deployment setup. This built-in static file handling simplifies asset management in Flask apps.\n",
        "18. What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API?\n",
        "A. An API specification is a formal, detailed description of an API’s endpoints, request and response formats, parameters, authentication, and error handling. It acts as a blueprint or contract that defines how clients and servers communicate. In building a Flask API, an API specification helps by providing clear guidelines for development, ensuring consistency and interoperability. It aids in designing endpoints before coding, simplifies testing and documentation, and improves collaboration among developers. Tools like OpenAPI can generate code and documentation from the specification, speeding up Flask API development and reducing errors.\n",
        "19. What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n",
        "A. HTTP status codes are standardized numerical codes sent by a server in response to a client’s HTTP request, indicating the result of that request. They categorize outcomes like success (e.g., 200 OK), client errors (e.g., 404 Not Found), and server errors (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error). In a Flask API, status codes are important because they communicate clearly whether an operation succeeded or failed, guiding clients on how to handle the response. Proper use of status codes improves API reliability, debugging, and user experience by making interactions predictable and meaningful.\n",
        "20.  How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n",
        "A. To handle POST requests in Flask, you define a route that explicitly accepts the POST method by specifying it in the route’s methods parameter. Inside the associated view function, you access the incoming data sent by the client through Flask’s `request` object, which lets you retrieve form data, JSON payloads, or files. After processing the data—such as validating input or saving it—you typically return a response indicating success or failure. This approach enables Flask to receive and process data sent by clients, making it essential for creating APIs that accept new or updated information.\n",
        "21. How would you secure a Flask API?\n",
        "A. To secure a Flask API, you can implement several best practices:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Authentication:** Use token-based methods like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth to verify user identity.\n",
        "2. **Authorization:** Restrict access to resources based on user roles or permissions.\n",
        "3. **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all incoming data to prevent injection attacks.\n",
        "4. **Use HTTPS:** Encrypt data in transit with SSL/TLS to protect against eavesdropping.\n",
        "5. **Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of requests per user/IP to prevent abuse.\n",
        "6. **Error Handling:** Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.\n",
        "7. **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update Flask and related packages to patch vulnerabilities.Together, these measures help protect the API from common security threats.\n",
        "22. What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension?\n",
        "A. Flask-RESTful is an extension that simplifies building RESTful APIs with Flask by providing helpful abstractions and tools. It streamlines defining API resources, handling HTTP methods, and managing request parsing and response formatting. Flask-RESTful organizes API endpoints as resource classes, making the code more modular and easier to maintain. It also offers built-in support for input validation, automatic error handling, and content negotiation. Overall, Flask-RESTful accelerates development, enforces REST principles, and improves code clarity and scalability in Flask-based API projects.\n",
        "23. What is the role of Flask’s session object?\n",
        "A. Flask’s session object is used to store information specific to a user across multiple requests, enabling stateful interactions in a stateless HTTP environment. It holds data on the server side but is linked to the client via a secure cookie. This allows you to remember user-specific details like login status, preferences, or shopping cart contents during their visit. The session object helps manage user sessions securely and conveniently without requiring database storage for every temporary piece of data, making it essential for features like authentication and personalized experiences in Flask applications.\n",
